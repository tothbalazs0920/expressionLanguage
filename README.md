Expressions
=======

**Expressions** is an educational tool for teaching lexers, parsers, and compilers used at the IT University of Copenhagen.

The core of the project was built by Peter Sestoft.

This includes automatic build targets for Coco/R.

The output is an Expressions.exe and a Machine.exe file in the Output folder.

Run either Expressions.exe or Machine.exe from the command line for more info.

The current version has full support for Visual Studio 2010, 2012, and Mono.
